# Services

Services are written in Node.js and built on top of
the [chassis module](https://github.com/restorecommerce/chassis-srv).
A Service can reach out to other services via an RPC interface,
offer an RPC interface, listen to events and emit events.

The existing services built for and based on Restorecommerce can be
identified by filtering The
[Restorecommerce repos](https://github.com/restorecommerce) for a `-srv`
suffix.
