# Microservices

A Restorecommerce application is a conglomerate of
[Microservices](http://nirmata.com/2015/02/microservices-five-architectural-constraints/)
which interact via asynchronous, **event driven communication** __and__ **RPC**.
Both communication styles are nicely [described here](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-microservices-inter-process-communication/).
A very lively description of event driven collaboration can be found
[here](https://www.nginx.com/blog/event-driven-data-management-microservices/).
